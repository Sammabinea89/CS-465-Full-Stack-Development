# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

My full-stack project included JavaScript, Express HTML, and a single-page application, among other frontend development tools. The front end of the website was made with JavaScript and HTML. JavaScript is used in the creation of the website's routes, controllers, and models in addition to the main application file, which exports the Express application. SPAs, or single-page applications, are made to offer admin features for basic website upkeep and updates. The Express pages are built on top of the HTML page and handlebar views.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database to hold some limited information, namely trip itinerary details and user login passwords. Schemas are not necessary with NoSQL because of how simple it is for users to save and modify data.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

The main distinction between JavaScript and JSON is that the latter is primarily utilized for data storage. JavaScript objects allow functions, but JSON does not allow them. JavaScript objects are exclusive to JavaScript; JSON is usable by other computer languages. JavaScript can also alter JSON data using a similar methodology. JSON data is used to transfer data from the server's backend to the frontend.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Enhancing functionality may be achieved by changing the pages to dynamically load entries from the database. These are the project's two main examples of code reworking. The first is moving HTML code that isn't needed to components that can be called from every page. The header and footer of a file may be called in order for them to display. They were designed to be handlebar partials.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The purpose of this application is to authenticate the user and provide authorization to alter database data using the API endpoints. Along with other data-related activities, these endpoints are used with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These endpoints must have security measures installed because if they don't, unauthorized users may be able to access the database and all of its contents.

Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? 

Professionally, this training has been beneficial to me. It's been difficult and difficult.Â Despite my work-related injuries, I believe this course has greatly enhanced my comprehension of the fundamentals of both front-end and back-end programming.

What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

In two months, when I will graduate from college, this course will have helped me consider my options for a job. Having a deeper grasp of how various code components really connect to create a final result in the end is, I believe, the greatest ability I have learned in this semester.
